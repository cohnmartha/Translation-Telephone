# Translation Telephone

![Logo](logo.png)

Translation Telephone is a project for my school's Language Lab that I have been working on! I completed the HTML/CSS tutorial from Interneting Is Hard and this website is built from what learned there. I have no other experience with coding or coding languages; I am a complete beginner! Any constructive criticism or commentary is greatly appreciated, and I hope you enjoy exploring the webpage a little bit!
